WEST VIRGINIA STATE PARK ADVENTURER
West Virginia State Park Adventurer is an application to list state parks and track state parks that the user has visited. This application provides individualized state park information, and a history of the formation of the West Virginia State Park system. Users can also keep notes or create a list for each individual state park visited. Users can keep track of the percentage of State Parks visited as well as compare their ranking with other users to find out who is a true State Park Adventurer.

The idea for this application was inspired by the West Virginia State Parks VIPP (Very Important Parks Person) program.   This program allows park visitors to receive a stamp for every park visited.   The State Park Adventurer Application makes this process digital and enhances the features of this program.  This Application provides a simple way to keep track of State Parks visited, while also providing information about each State Park for future adventures.
